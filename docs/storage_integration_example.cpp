// storage_integration_example.cpp
// Demo/example of integrating storage_helpers into setup() and loop().
// Moved from src/ to docs/ to avoid compiling demo code into the firmware.

// Example usage notes:
// - initLittleFS(), loadFromNVS(), appendSensorLog(), saveULongToNVS()
// - Shows how to persist relay state and fallback timestamps

// This file intentionally contains example/demo code only and is not meant to be compiled as part of the firmware.
