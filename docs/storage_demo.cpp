// storage_demo.cpp
// Demo/example for storage_helpers usage.
// Moved from src/ to docs/ to avoid compiling demo code into the firmware.
// If you need the original fuller demo, retrieve it from VCS history or ask to restore it here.

// Example usage notes:
// - Shows how to initialize LittleFS
// - Load/Save WiFi creds and device id in NVS
// - Append sensor readings to LittleFS as JSON lines
// - Persist relay state and last valid timestamp

// This file intentionally contains example/demo code only and is not meant to be compiled as part of the firmware.
